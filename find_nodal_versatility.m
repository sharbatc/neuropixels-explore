% find_nodal_versatility will calculate the versatility of each node
% in a network.  `g` is an NxN adjacency matrix, which can either be
% weighted or unweighted, directed or undirected.  `f` should be a
% function that takes an adjacency matrix (and optionally a parameter
% `a`) as its input(s) and returns a 1xN community affiliation matrix
% (i.e. a vector where each node is associated with an identifier, and
% nodes with the same identifier are in the same community).  The next
% optional argument is `it`, which is the number of iterations over
% which to calculate the versatility; usually the defualt of 1000 is
% more than enough, but this number can be reduced to around 100 for
% good approximations.  The last optional argument is `processors`,
% which should be greater than 1 if you would like to use
% parallelization, or 1 if you either a) use Octave or b) don't
% have the parallelization toolbox.
%
% This function will return the versatility of each node in the
% network as a 1xN vector.
%
% As you likely know, versatility describes how closely each node is
% affiliated with a module.  It does not depend on any particular
% modular structure; it only depends on the algorithm and its
% parametrization.  Averaging a node's versatility across many
% parameters creates a stable measure that is consistent across
% different algorithms in most networks, and also eliminates the
% dependence on the parameterization.
%
% This default argument for this function comes from the Brain
% Connectivity Toolbox for the "community_louvain" function, but it
% does not necessarily depend on this package.
%
% Example usage:
%
%     % Louvain versatility at gamma=2.0
%     find_nodal_versatility(G, @community_louvain, 2.0)
%     % Louvain versatility at gamma=1.0, run on 3 processors
%     find_nodal_versatility(G, [], [], [], 3)

% run of the function `f`.  The arguments should satisfy the same
